- The endpoint https://api.stonks.com/principal/event?status=upcoming&perPage=25&orderBy=starts_at,ASC returns a JSON object of our live prod events data
- Create a webpage using NextJS and Tailwind CSS that processes and presents the data to show upcoming events.
- Feel free to use external libraries to help fetch and present the data. Make the page appealing!
- Show a browsing user these are events they don't want to miss! Impress us with your skills!
- At a minimum, each card should display the title, date of the event, image, and the panelists.
